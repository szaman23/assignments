<!-- WAI which stands for “Web Accessiblity Initiative” (as defined by w3schools), gives developers some guidelines about how to make web pages accessible to all users, on all devices. 
It is important to make sure that users with disabilities can easily view and interact with websites, and that the website can be viewed on all devices. For example, some people might have color blindness so if the text on a webpage has low contrast it will be difficult for these users to read the text. 
Also, nowadays most people browse the internet on their cell phones. So for example if the text size is too small, users will not be able to view the text properly. 
WAI guidelines ensure that conditions for accessibility are met by setting some conformance standards- such as what kind of contrast to use, how long to use flashing lights, etc. 
There are 3 standards, or criteria, by which a website is evaluated. These are Level A (lowest level of conformance), AA, and AAA (highest). Developers can check which level their website is at, by finding out the requirements of each level and comparing their website to it. The developer can then use logos on the website to specify the level of conformance of the site. It is up to the developer to ensure that he/she has placed the correct logo for his/her website.
For example, a level A conformance criteria is that everything on the website that is not text, such as images, audio, video, etc.should have a text alternative.
A level AA criteria is that headings should describe something. 
A website which satisfies level AAA criteria would have a text-resizing option, where the width of the text does not exceed a specified limit and there is enough line spacing between paragraphs.

If a developer adheres to the WAI guidelines and conforms to level AAA standards, it will ensure a high quality website that can be accessible to all users on all devices.
