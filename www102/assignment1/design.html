<article>
<p>Usually when I'm looking for a good restaurant, I’m browsing from my phone, and I’m in a hurry. I don’t want to spend more than 10 minutes deciding on a restaurant.  This means I don't want to dive into the website to look for a menu or have to scroll and look around for  hours and locations.
 My ideal user experience would be to just click on a website, be greeted with a simple, clean design without any audio/video and too many “cool effects” which distracts me from what I’m looking for. I like it when I can see the hours and the location on the home page by scrolling down to the bottom, and the menu is also easily accessible from the home page, which should include all food items along with the prices.</p>
 </article>

<article>
	<p>Keeping that in mind, here are some of the websites I used as the benchmarks for my website:</p>
    
		<p class="color">http://www.terroni.com/</p>
		<p class="color">The things I liked best about this design was:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Instead of showing all the locations in tiny text at the bottom of the home page, the locations are right on top of the page. This was very helpful because often the first thing I’m looking for is the location closest to me and this website did a great job at reducing the time needed to do this.</li>
			<li>The online reservation option came up in bold letters as soon as I opened the main page. The reservation process was easy to use as well. </li>
			<li>The restaurant hours were also displayed conveniently in the middle of the page, so I didn’t have to scroll down all the way to the bottom.</li>
			<li>The navigation menu was not overly cluttered. It included important links, such as making reservations and booking events instead of the usual ‘About Us’ and ‘Contact Us’ (which no one really visits for restaurant websites).</li>
	</ul>
    
<p class="color">What I didn’t like about the design:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The background images weren’t that great. On first sight, it looked as if someone had jammed a lot of white text on some unrelated images. I would have preferred cleaner, less colourful background images.</li>
		<li>I would have liked to see more images of the food served at the restaurant,  instead of pictures of the locations.</li>
		<li>The menu layout looked undeveloped. The font used for the menu items had no styling and was hard to see. The prices didn’t have any currency listed and the menu titles were in Italian instead of English.</li>
		<li>I had to use the scrollbar to look at the full menu, which was a little annoying. So overall the menu system wasn’t done very well.</li>
	</ul>
</article>

<p class="color">http://zenjapaneserestaurant.com/</p>
	<ul>
<li>This was also an example of good website design. The things I liked best was:</li>
<li>The colour choices were really good. The design was clean and uncluttered, and had the right amount of images and text. The background colours were also really nice.</li>
<li>Like any good website, everything was easily accessible on the home page. The navigation menu was styled very nicely.</li>
<li>I really liked the banner images which changed every few seconds. It added to the beauty of the home page without making it seem out of place. The logo and the Japanese words added to the Zen-esque feeling of the website. </li>	
	</ul>

<p class="color">What I didn’t like:</p>
	<ul>
<li>The only thing that I didn't like was that  the website was too simplistic. There was nothing on the home page except the banner images so I had to click on the navigation items. I would have liked to see a few essentials (such as reservations and menu) on the home page. </li>
<li>There was also no way to make an online reservation. The full menu wasn't available either.</li>
	</ul>

<article>
<p class="color">http://www.fifteen.net/</p>
	<p>This website (Jamie Oliver’s restaurant) was named on an article as an example of  great website design, and I thought it was excellent as well.</p>
	<p>What I liked about the design:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Everything is on one page. I didn’t have to navigate through the menu to make a reservation or find out about the food. It was all on the home page and presented in a very simple, clean and clear layout.</li>
			<li>The online reservation system was simple and easy to use. I liked this feature as this is one of the first things that customers usually look for.</li>
			<li>The menu layout was excellent, with the meals and pricing all displayed conveniently beside one another. It seemed as if I was looking at a real menu.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="color">What I didn’t like about the design:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> I didn’t like about his design was the font size. It was too small to see clearly. </li>
			<li>The background color was the same throughout the page, including the color in the online registration form, so the whole website looked somewhat boring. I would have liked to see more variety  instead of the same pale colour and font styling throughout all the pages. </li>
		</ul>

<article>
	<p class="color">http://www.namirestaurant.ca/</p>
   
	<p class="color">What I liked about the design:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The column layout is easy to use. The home page featured the hours and the location in a very convenient way.</li>
			<li>The navigation menu was used in a column layout and it worked out really well. The food menu had sub-menus for lunch, dinner, etc.I could view just by hovering over the list which was a nice touch. </li>
	</ul>

	<p class="color">What I didn’t like about the design:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> I didn't really like the column layout for the rest of the pages. It looked as if all the text was squashed into one column. I would have preferred to see more spacing. The background image gallery also showed up on every page, which I thought was unncessary. It would have been sufficient to just use it on the home page instead of having it show up everywhere.</li>
		</ul>

 <h2 class="color">Audience</h2> 
 	<p>I expect my audience to be young-between 20-35 years of age, and mostly tech-savvy. This is because older people usually don't rely on websites to find out about restaurants, they get recommendations from other people whereas younger people tend to trust online recommendations as well.</p>
    <p> I also expect them to live in or around Toronto, as it is a local restaurant. They will want to try out something new and will have interest in food from different cultures or will already have exposure to Japanese food. They will probably be young professionals/well-educated people. </p>
</article>      
    
  <article>  
  <h2 class="color">Layout</h2>
  <p> None of the competitor sites (except for Nami Japanese Restaurant) used columns. I chose not to use columns either because:
  - It makes everything looks "squashed" 
  - Text inside columns are hard to read, and if there is a lot of text, columns can start looking like newspaper articles, which is not good for a website. Users want to be able to see everything clearly, and not have to scroll down or put in effort to read the text.</p>
 <p> Most of my competitor sites used a responsive (fluid) layout which displayed properly on all browser sizes. When the browser window was adjusted, the navigation menu and certain other elements were automatically displayed in a different way as well. I didn't use this layout since I didn't know how to make websites responsive. Even though I tried to make certain elements responsive (such as the header and about us paragraphs) I was unable to do so which is why I decided to keep it fixed-width.</p> 
 <p>I chose the fixed-width layout because I wanted the elements to appear exactly as they are on a full size monitor (2880X1800). Since I was not designing for mobile users, I didn't need the website to be responsive. So my website will display properly on a full-screen monitor but users on mobile devices, tablets, etc. will have to scroll horizontally to see the whole page.<br>
One thing that came to mind was that the site might not display properly on monitors with lower screen resolutions. However, statistics from w3schools.com shows that 57% of users have monitors with resolutions greater than 1024x768. So most users will be able to view my site properly from desktop computers. At the same time, I didn't set it to be max-width since I wanted the website to span the whole width on a full screen monitor. Also, I didn't want any white space on the sides, which in my opinion, gives off an empty, unfinished feeling to a website.</p>

<h2 class="color"> Colour choices and Font choices</h2>

<p>Colour choices- Most of the competititor sites used around 2-3 colours. For example, http://zenjapaneserestaurant.com/ used a purple, white and black colour palette while http://www.namirestaurant.ca used red, white and black colours. Only http://www.fifteen.net/ used a single colour palette (black text on white background). So most of the competitor sites used:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Either a primary colour (red) or a secondary colour (purple) for the body of the website</li>
	<li>The header/footer in a different colour (usually gray or black)</li>
	<li>And the fonts a different colour (usually black or white). </li>
</ul>

<p>I also used a secondary colour (orange) for the body of my website, black for the header and footer and white/black for the text. So my website looks the most similar to the Nami Restaurant website (reddish background, black and white fonts).
I deviated a little from my competitors' colour choices by using a slightly different secondary colour and by using different colours for the headers and paragraphs. I decided to use a reddish-orange colour because it matched the red colour of my banner image. I used black for the header/footer as it gives off a professional vibe and also matches with the black wrapping of sushi. </p>

<p>Font choices - All the competitor sites used mainly one or two fonts. Some used webfonts while others didn't. For example,  http://www.terroni.com/ used the Roboto Slab webfont whereas http://www.namirestaurant.ca used the Arial and Helvetica fonts. <br>
I preferred the websites which used webfonts, as the fonts were bigger, had more spacing and were easier to see compared to the default ones. That is why I also chose to use two webfonts (one for headings, another for text) because:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Webfonts look better than the default fonts</li>
    <li>To add more variety to the website, and </li>
     <li>To visually separate the headings from the text. </li>
 </ul>

<h2 class="color">Menu Styling</h2>
<p>Most websites nowadays have the navigation menu had the logo and the menu items all on the same line. This
now seems to be the standard for modern website design. I also chose to style the header and the menu bar the same way because it makes a website look professional. Websites which have a heading at the top and the menu at the bottom looks more like a 90's era website. If both are on the same line, it diverts the attention away from the logo/header so the user can focus on the navigation menu.  Adding both to the same line adds to the simplicity of the design and is aesthetically pleasing as well. </p>
</article>

<article>
<h2 class="color"> Other</h2>
<p>I chose different styles from different websites based on the designs that I liked the most about each of them. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li> For the header and the menu navigation bar, I copied the styles from Terroni because I liked their style the most. </li>
    <li>For the reservation system, I took inspiration from Fifteen. It gave me all the information I needed (such as hours and email addresses) and allowed me to make a reservation at the same time. </li>
     <li>For the About Us part, I "borrowed" the text from Nami Restaurant and used a combination of the styles from Zen Japanese and Terroni. Instead of using a lot of text on a white background beside some images, I decided to put the text on top of the image for a clearer design. </li>
     <li>For Contact Us, I again used a combination of styles from Terroni and Zen Japanese. Since I only had one location for my website, I put the whole Contact Us paragraph in the footer.</li>
     <li>I decided to keep everything on one page as I prefer the one-page-layout but also included links to the other parts of the page. Here I again took ideas from Fifteen as they did it the same way and it proved to be the easiest to navigate (i.e. everything on one page but if you need more info or want to view only a selected section, use the menu to jump to that section.) </li>
</ul>
